# Project3

In this project we will determine the ground state correlation energy between two electrons in an helium atom by calculating a six-dimensional integral that appears in many quantum mechanical applications.

This project consists of:

###Project3 (folder)
Contains the project code (C++) and selected results for runs of the code for the different integration points.

The output files are located in the build-Project3-Desktop_Qt_5_5_0_MinGW_32bit-Debug folder, the build-Project3-Desktop_Qt_5_5_0_clang_64bit-Debug folder, and the build-Project3-Desktop_Qt_5_5_0_clang_64bit-Release folder.

###Report (folder)
Contains the report.
